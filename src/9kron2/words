To compile and use it you have to:

!	bind -c libc /sys/src/libc
!	bind  -b include /sys/include


This is 9k, from jmk, changed by rminnich, and
further changed to use 2M pages.

This is the first version that worked with such pgsz.
You might be also interested in a (non-working) version
that was a previous attempt, found in the dump
at /sys/src/9kron2M, and removed when this tree was created.
